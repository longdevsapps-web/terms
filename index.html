By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <p>The App provides logging, tracking, and educational features for general fitness purposes only. <strong>It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</strong> Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before starting or changing any exercise, nutrition, or wellness program. Use at your own risk. Do not use the App for emergencies.</p>

    <h2>4. Accounts &amp; security</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for providing accurate information, maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials, and all activities under your account. We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms or applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions, in-app purchases &amp; billing</h2>
    <p>If paid features are offered (e.g., subscriptions, one-time purchases), billing and refunds are handled by the platform you purchased through (Apple App Store or Google Play). Review the platform’s billing terms and refund policies. We may change pricing or features prospectively; changes take effect in the next billing period or as communicated by the platform.</p>

    <h2>6. User content &amp; data</h2>
    <p>You may input content such as workouts, sets, weights, photos, notes, and preferences (“<strong>User Content</strong>”). You retain ownership of your User Content. By submitting User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, process, and display it solely to operate and improve the App.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for your User Content and warrant that it does not infringe others’ rights, violate law, or contain harmful content.</p>
    <p><strong>Data export &amp; deletion.</strong><br>
      • You can export local data via the App’s Settings (if available).<br>
      • You can request deletion of your account and associated cloud data via the App (if available) or by emailing <a href="mailto:long.devs.apps@gmail.com">long.devs.apps@gmail.com</a>. We may need to verify your identity.</p>
    <p>For details on what we collect and why, see our <a href="https://longdevsapps-web.github.io/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where permitted by law.</li>
      <li>Circumvent security, access accounts or data without authorization, or interfere with the App’s operation.</li>
      <li>Post or transmit unlawful, harmful, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or infringing content.</li>
      <li>Use automated means (bots, scrapers) except through documented APIs (if any).</li>
      <li>Misrepresent your identity or affiliation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>Except for your User Content, the App (software, design, logos, and other content) is owned by or licensed to us and protected by intellectual property laws. Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-party services &amp; links</h2>
    <p>The App may integrate or link to third-party services. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party services. Your use of them may be subject to their terms and privacy policies.</p>

    <h2>10. Beta features &amp; changes to the service</h2>
    <p>We may release features labeled as alpha, beta, or early access. Such features may be unstable or change. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App or any part of it at any time.</p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of warranties</h2>
    <p><strong>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided “as is” and “as available.”</strong> We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, availability, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, profits, revenue, or business, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App, even if advised of the possibility. Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid to us for the App in the 12 months before the claim, or (b) EUR 20. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.</p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Calify and our affiliates, officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your use of the App, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or law.</p>

    <h2>14. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the App at any time and may delete your account as described above. We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if you violate these Terms or we are required to by law. Upon termination, licenses end and you must cease all use. Sections that by their nature should survive termination will survive.</p>

    <h2>15. Governing law &amp; venue</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>Germany</strong>, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. If you are a consumer residing in the EU/EEA/UK, you may also enjoy mandatory protections of your local consumer laws. The exclusive place of jurisdiction is our registered place of business, except where consumer law provides otherwise.</p>

    <h2>16. Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will change the “Last updated” date above and, where required, provide additional notice (e.g., in-app). Your continued use of the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.</p>
